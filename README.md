## Introduction
With a Masterâ€™s in Analytics from RMIT University, I am embarking on a strategic transition from business analysis and product management to specializing in Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC). My background in analytics equips me with a keen ability to leverage data-driven insights to enhance risk management and compliance strategies. Passionate about shaping robust frameworks and implementing effective audit practices, I am committed to driving innovation and excellence in the GRC field. I aim to integrate my analytical skills with cutting-edge GRC practices to tackle complex challenges and deliver impactful solutions.

## Objective
I aim to showcase my expertise and experience in my Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) journey through the curated portfolios of projects and documents on GitHub.

## Skills
I have a strong foundation in business analysis, where I successfully gathered and analyzed requirements, mapped processes, and managed stakeholder relationships to deliver clear, actionable insights that improved project outcomes. 
As a product Manager, I led the entire product lifecycle, from market research to roadmap development, guiding cross-functional teams to deliver products that met market needs and business goals. My experience in functional testing includes designing test cases, ensuring quality through rigorous testing, and efficiently resolving defects, leading to the successful deployment of high-quality solutions. Now, as I transition into Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC), I am leveraging my analytical skills to conduct thorough risk assessments, implement compliance frameworks, develop robust policies, and enhance cybersecurity practices, all aimed at reducing risks and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
